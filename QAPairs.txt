Pair 1: Eligibility & Payment
Question: How do I ensure I'm eligible for the rental car insurance on both the ScotiaGold Passport VISA and the Scotiabank Commercial Visa? Are there differences in how payment must be handled, especially regarding reward points?
Answer:
For Both Cards: You must decline the rental agency's Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) or Loss Damage Waiver (LDW). The rental must be in your name as the cardholder.
ScotiaGold Passport VISA (Doc 1): You must initiate the rental with your ScotiaGold VISA (e.g., provide an imprint at pickup). You must either charge the entire cost to your Account OR use Scotia RewardsÂ® points to pay for all or part of the rental, charging any remaining cost to your ScotiaGold Passport VISA account.
Scotiabank Commercial Visa (Doc 2): You must use your Canadian dollar Scotiabank Visa* Commercial Card (or CTA) to pay for the entire rental. Using points is mentioned for receiving free rental days (from travel rewards etc.), but the condition is that if combined with paid days, the entire balance must be paid with the Commercial Card. It doesn't explicitly mention using points directly for partial payment like the ScotiaGold policy.

Pair 2: Maximum Rental Duration
Question: What is the maximum number of consecutive days I can rent a vehicle and still be covered by the insurance for both the personal ScotiaGold and the Commercial Visa card?
Answer:
For both the ScotiaGold Passport VISA (Doc 1, Section 2) and the Scotiabank Commercial Visa (Doc 2, Section A & B), the maximum length of time you can rent the same vehicle and be covered is 48 consecutive days. If the rental period exceeds 48 days, no coverage is provided, even for the first 48 days.

Pair 3: Exotic Car Coverage
Question: I want to rent a Ferrari. Are exotic cars like this covered under the Collision/Loss Damage insurance for either the ScotiaGold Passport VISA or the Scotiabank Commercial Visa?
Answer:
No, exotic cars like a Ferrari are NOT covered under either policy.
The ScotiaGold Passport VISA policy (Doc 1, Section 5) explicitly lists "Exotic cars" as not covered and provides examples including Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, Aston Martin, etc.
The Scotiabank Commercial Visa policy (Doc 2, Section G) also lists "exotic vehicles" as not covered.

Pair 4: Claim Reporting Timeframe & Contact
Question: If I have an accident in a rental car, how soon do I need to report the claim, and who do I contact for the ScotiaGold Passport VISA versus the Scotiabank Commercial Visa?
Answer:
Timeframe: For both policies, you must report the claim as soon as possible.
ScotiaGold Passport VISA (Doc 1, Section 8) specifies "certainly within 48 hours of the damage or theft having occurred."
Scotiabank Commercial Visa (Doc 2, "IN THE EVENT...") specifies reporting "Within 48 hours".
Contact Information: The contact points are different:
ScotiaGold Passport VISA (Doc 1): Call Scotia Assist at 1-800-756-4941 (Canada/US) or (416) 977-6707 (collect elsewhere). Claims administered by World Travel Protection Canada Inc.
Scotiabank Commercial Visa (Doc 2): Call the administrator+ (Manulife/Global Excel Management) at 1-833-389-1090 (toll-free Canada/Continental USA) or (519) 945-1813 (collect elsewhere).

Pair 5: Scope of Coverage (What's Paid)
Question: What specific costs are covered by the Collision/Loss Damage insurance for both cards if the rental vehicle is damaged or stolen? Does it cover just the repairs?
Answer:
Both policies cover more than just the direct repair cost, up to the actual cash value of the vehicle.
ScotiaGold Passport VISA (Doc 1, Section 3): Covers the amount you are liable for up to the actual cash value of the damaged/stolen vehicle, plus valid and documented Loss of Use, reasonable and customary towing charges, and administration charges resulting from the damage/theft.
Scotiabank Commercial Visa (Doc 2, Section B): Compensates You or the Rental Agency for loss/damages up to the actual cash value of the rental vehicle and valid Rental Agency Loss of Use charges. (Towing/administration charges aren't explicitly mentioned in this summary section like in Doc 1, but the core coverage is similar: Actual Cash Value + Loss of Use).
