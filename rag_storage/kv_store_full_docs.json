If possible, select a Rental Agency which provides an excellent rate  AND  allows  You  to decline  \nthe CDW  without  having  to make  a deposit.  \n8   \nRental Agencies in some countries may resist Your declining their CDW coverage. These Rental  Age ncies \nmay try to encourage You to take their coverage or to provide a deposit.
