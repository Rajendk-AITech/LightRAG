The documents specify that most types of vehicles are covered, but they also highlight exclusions and conditions under which coverage is not provided.\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **General Coverage**: The insurance covers most private passenger vehicles rented for personal and business use. However, specific vehicle types, such as those used for commercial purposes or certain specialty vehicles, might be excluded.\n\n2. **Exclusions**: The documents do not provide a detailed list of excluded vehicle types, but they emphasize that coverage is for private passenger vehicles. If utility vehicles are used for commercial purposes, they might fall outside the scope of coverage.\n\n3. **Rental Requirements**: To activate coverage, the rental must be paid in full with the appropriate Scotiabank Visa card, and the rental agency's Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) must be declined.\n\nIf you are considering renting a utility vehicle, it is advisable to check the specific terms and conditions of the insurance policy or contact the insurer directly to confirm whether such vehicles are covered.\n\n### References\n- [DC] EN_Commercial_CLD_CAD.pdf\n- [KG] rental_car_insurance.pdf",

      "return": "### Eligibility for Rental Car Insurance\n\nTo ensure eligibility for rental car insurance with both the ScotiaGold Passport VISA and the Scotiabank Commercial Visa, you must adhere to specific conditions outlined in the insurance policy.\n\n#### ScotiaGold Passport VISA\n\n1. **Initiate the Rental with the Card**: You must use your ScotiaGold Passport VISA to initiate the rental transaction. This includes booking or reserving the car rental in advance and providing a card imprint at the time of taking possession of the car.\n\n2. **Decline the Rental Agency's CDW/LDW**: You must decline the rental agency’s Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) or Loss Damage Waiver (LDW) or any similar provision.\n\n3. **Payment Requirements**:\n   - **Full Payment with Card**: Charge the entire cost of the car rental to your ScotiaGold Passport VISA account.\n   - **Use of Scotia Rewards Points**: If you are a ScotiaGold Passport VISA Cardmember, you can use Scotia Rewards points to pay for all or part of the rental. If the points do not cover the entire cost, the remaining amount must be charged to your ScotiaGold Passport VISA account.\n\n#### Scotiabank Commercial Visa\n\nThe document does not provide specific details on the Scotiabank Commercial Visa's rental car insurance eligibility. However, it is generally advisable to follow similar steps as those for the ScotiaGold Passport VISA, ensuring full payment with the card and declining the rental agency's CDW/LDW.\n\n### Differences in Payment Handling\n\nThe ScotiaGold Passport VISA explicitly allows the use of Scotia Rewards points for payment, provided any remaining balance is charged to the card. There is no specific mention of reward points usage for the Scotiabank Commercial Visa in the provided document chunks.\n\n### References\n- [DC] rental_car_insurance.pdf",
