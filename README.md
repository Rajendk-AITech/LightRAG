🚀 Build Fast, Accurate & Affordable Insurance AI with OpenAI + LightRAG!
In this in-depth tutorial, we break down how to use LightRAG — a high-performance, graph-augmented retrieval system — with OpenAI’s GPT-4o and text-embedding-3-small for insurance document analysis. Whether you're building GenAI SaaS tools for underwriting, claims analysis, or compliance, this tutorial shows how to save cost and boost accuracy using LightRAG’s dual-level retrieval framework.

🤖 LLM Configuration :

LLM Model: GPT-4o via OpenAI API
Max Tokens: 32,768 | Temperature: 0.5 | Async Requests: 4
Caching Enabled for Faster Inference & Deduplication

📊 Embedding Config:
Model: text-embedding-3-small (OpenAI)
Dimensions: 1536 | API Binding: openai/v1
📄 Real-World Use Case:
We analyze lengthy and regulated insurance PDFs to demonstrate smart querying: policy clauses, coverage limits, eligibility rules, and multi-hop reasoning (e.g., “Can this claim be rejected due to Section 6 exclusions?”).

🧠 Why LightRAG for Insurance + OpenAI?
60–70% fewer tokens/API calls vs GraphRAG
Only 1 LLM call per query (vs community x tokens in GraphRAG)
Dual-level Local/Global retrieval = better factual grounding
Optimized for hybrid/hierarchical data like Insurance policies
Works even with OpenAI token/credit limits or pay-per-use plans
Great for Regulated Domains: Insurance, Legal, Healthcare
